		<h1> Bias in police stops in the USA </h1>

			<p>
				More than 20 million Americans are stopped for traffic violations each year, making
				it one of the most common ways for the public to interface with the police. However,
				there has never been a comprehensive national repository containing information on these
				interactions. To alter that, the Open Policing Stanford dataset collaborated with Big
				Local News to collect a dataset of over 200 million traffic stops done in dozens of cities
				and states throughout the US, making it the largest such endeavor to date.
				It has become a valuable resource for politicians, scholars, journalists, and campaigners
				striving to improve policing via data. In our turn, we too want to help ameliorate policing
				and we will do so in our visualizations by raising awareness on potential racial and gender
				biases in police stops.

			<h3>Map View plot</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, we want to investigate a potential variation in racial bias in police stops from 2009 to 2016. 
				We also want to explore, in case such variations exist, if those are constant across different states of America.
				It will be possible to visualize the respective number of police arrest of Black, White and Hispanic persons
				in the different counties of California and Texas. With the help of a cursor it will be possible to observe
				the evolution of the number of arrests between 2009 and 2016.

			<h4>Hit Rate plot</h4>
			<p>
				We want to focus on illustrating potential bias by measuring the hit rate (an arrested person is found guilty
				of an infraction). The size of the bubbles will represent the number of arrests and, the (x,y) position,
				will illustrate the hit rate of each population in Texas compared to the respective hit rate in California.
