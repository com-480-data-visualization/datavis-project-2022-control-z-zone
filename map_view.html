				Here is the map of the USA. To be able to see the number of stops by county, you have to click on two states. 
				The states that can be clicked on are the ones in red, which means that the data are processed. Once you have clicked you will visualize
				the number of police stops by ethnicity, normalized by the population of this ethnicity in the county.

				In this comparison analysis tool it is possible to select whether you want to view a 
				comparison based on race or gender and select correponding ethnicity or gender of your choice. Hovering
				with your mouse will display the county name together with the number of stops for
				that particular category (selected race or gender) and the corresponding stop ratio defined as the <b>number of stops for the category
				divided by the number of inhabitants of that category</b>, per county. When the relative stop ratio
				is higher for one ethnicity than the others, we can consider a bias toward that ethnicity. <br>
				<br>
				Although, we noticed an unwanted pattern in some counties where the stop ratio exceeds 1, meaning
				that there are more people stopped than people who live there for a given category. This can be explained by
				the number of tourists or simply travellers that come to that county.
				For example, in the Sierra and Alpine counties in California we observe a very high relative
				ratios for every category (above 2). This is due to the fact that those counties are very famous for
				their sky stations or mountain activities and attract a great number of tourists every year who are naturally not
				counted in the county population. It is important to note that this doesn’t constitute a
				bias towards any ethnicity since the ratio, although high, is similar in both those counties.
				Comparing California and Texas, we can see relatively <b>higher ratios in Texas</b> overall
				than in California indicating generaly more frequent police stops. Another observable
				phenomenon we can observe is the relative ratio of stops near the border with Mexico
				in South-West Texas is also high for each ethnicities, due to control at borders, we can’t
				observe any clear bias at borders, indeed relative stops ratios are increasing there for all
				categories of populations. <br>
				<br>
				For gender however, we observe a constantly <b>higher relative ratio of stops for
				males than females</b>. This remains the case from 2009 to 2016 and is true for both
				California and Texas. <br>
				<br>
				Finally, when selecting Asian or Black populations, we seem to observe higher stop ratios
				for these populations compared to White and Hispanic people. This could represent a
				bias of police stops towards Asians and Blacks. But, this could also be due to the fact that
				both of these ethnicities appear in much lesser proportion in the states of California and
				Texas, provoking a bias in our results due to arrest of non-inhabitants which inflates the
				ratio disproportionately.<br>

				On the left hand side, you can see the total number of stops for each ethnicity in California as a function of the year. Similarly on the right,
				you can see the total number of stops by ethnicity for Texas. We can see that the number of police stops for the time range 2009-2016 remains quite constant
				for blacks and asians / pacific islanders in both states. <br>
				<br>
				However, we observe two different trends for white and hispanics, both in California and in Texas.
				For California, the number of stops for those two ethnicities decrease steadily from 2010 to 2016. Then we see a sharp drop for 2016 with almost 1 million
				less stops for whites and 700k for hispanics. There can be multiple reasons for this, one of them being that the data we used is police stops of the state patrol and a change in policy might have led
				to traffic stops being done with a different police authority instead.
				For Texas, the number of hispanics stopped remains quite constant, but we see a steady decrease of the number of whites stopped from 2009-2015 where
				it remains constant at around 800k.
